# Rivals-Replay-Organizer

Organizes Rivals of Aether replays.

**TURN ON AUTO REPLAYS**

**HIT SAVE REPLAY AFTER THE LAST REPLAY OF THE SET HAS BEEN SAVED**

Automatically create zips of match sets to avoid the hassle of going through your replay folder and finding the right matches to send to a stream!

Tags player names, dates, and game numbers.

PM me any bugs/suggestions on Github or at Discord: CheesyPotato#5378

# Building from source

`python setup.py build`

Kind of useless though, if you're reading this you have Python installed so just clone the source and run `rivalsreplayorganizer.py` lol
